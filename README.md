# JP Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Experience (Forage)

This project was completed as part of the **J.P. Morgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Internship** offered by **Forage**.

## 🔍 Overview

This simulation involved designing a backend Spring Boot system to mimic real-world transaction processing at a financial institution. It covers transaction validation, user balance updates, incentive calculation, and REST API integration.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

- **Task 1:** Retrieve user data and initialize balances
- **Task 2:** Implement core transaction processing
- **Task 3:** Create API endpoint to query user balances
- **Task 4:** Integrate external REST API for incentive calculations
- **Task 5:** Test the application using JUnit and simulate production scenarios

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
- RESTful APIs
- JUnit 5

## 📁 Repo Highlights

- `entity/` – UserRecord, TransactionRecord, IncentiveRecord
- `repository/` – Spring Data Repositories
- `service/` – Business logic with Incentive and Transaction handling
- `controller/` – REST APIs for transaction processing and balance queries
- `test/` – JUnit test cases for all functional components
